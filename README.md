# TODO

* Get the styling cleaned so the markup doesn't have a `<p />` which is not legal.
* I sometimes see a focus issue for the on mouseover CSS.

# Changes

* Ripped out the style markup from HTML and pushed into style.css.
* Ripped out the onclick from HTML and enabled via script.js.
* Removed expectation that previews would be in the same order as modal HTML.
* Removed all modal HTML except for a single template.
* Made some special work for prev/next to work correctly in all cases.
* Performance improvements.
* Reduced expectations on the HTML.
